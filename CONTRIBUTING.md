# Contributing to LBBS

Thank you for helping improve the LLM Billing & Benchmarking Standard (LBBS).

## Ways to contribute
- Open an issue with the appropriate template:
  - **Proposal feedback**: definitions, metrics, protocol, compliance levels
  - **Data submission**: pilot results (attach CSV + metadata)
  - **Bug/errata**: editorial or technical corrections
- Submit a pull request with proposed text edits to the draft (place changes under `docs/` or comment inline).

## Ground rules
- Be precise, evidence‑based, and respectful.
- Provide reproducible steps for pilots and include raw metadata.
- Avoid vendor‑specific marketing claims; focus on measurable outcomes.

## Development process
- We maintain the canonical PDF in `docs/`.
- Substantial changes will be tagged with draft versions (v0.1, v0.2, …).
- After public comment phases, we will publish a change log and merge accepted edits.
